## Hello, my name is Thiago, and I am passionate about technology. I enjoy learning and challenging myself, which is why here you will find a series of codes and feats that I have accomplished using programmingâ€”or not.

I am a Data Analyst and have spent part of my life analyzing information to conduct feasibility studies and product development. Currently, I am a Technician and am continually striving to strengthen this foundation.

Welcome! On my profile, you can find my LinkedIn if you'd like to send me a message!

I really enjoy developing in Python, but I can also talk about:
* SQL  
* MS Excel  
* ETL  
* Dashboards  
* Data Analysis  
* Business Automation with Workflow and Decision Tools  
* RPA (Robotic Process Automation)  
* Strategy.
